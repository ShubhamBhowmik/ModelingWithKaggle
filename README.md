Welcome to my GitHub repository! This repository serves as a collection of all my work aimed at enhancing my skills and knowledge in data science, machine learning, and related fields. It contains various projects and experiments that I have worked on to continuously upgrade and improve myself.

Repository Structure
Main Branch: The main branch of this repository includes an overview and general documentation of my journey and progress in data science. It serves as a landing point for all my projects.

Project Branches: Each branch other than the main branch represents a specific project I have worked on. These projects are organized separately to reflect the unique goals, methodologies, and outcomes of each initiative.

Feel free to explore the branches to dive into individual projects and see the work I've been doing to grow in the data science field. Thank you for visiting!
